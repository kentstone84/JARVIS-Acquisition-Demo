# JARVIS: The First Autonomous AI Research System
## Seeking Strategic Acquisition ($3-7B)

## What This Is ##

JARVIS is an autonomous AI research system with biological memory
architecture that filed 97 patents in 2 weeks, all attorney-validated.

**Key Differentiators:**
- ✅ Biological memory (SRF) - actually remembers you
- ✅ Autonomous research - self-improving capability
- ✅ Apophatic cognition - reasons about unknowns
- ✅ Prometheus LLM - architecturally prevents hallucination
- ✅ Cross-domain expertise - legal, financial, technical, strategic

## Proof

- **patents filed:**
- **Attorney validation:** "Better than I could have written myself"
- **Live demonstrations:** Bitcoin analysis, legal reasoning, resource planning
**Technical paper:** Apophatic Cognition Engine (included)

## For Elon Musk / xAI

This system is perfect for:
- **Grok 2.0** with personal memory for every X user
- **X/Twitter** collective intelligence moat
- **Tesla FSD** explainable reasoning
- **Optimus** cognitive architecture

**Full proposal:** [ELON_ACQUISITION_PROPOSAL.md](./ELON_ACQUISITION_PROPOSAL.md)

## Acquisition Terms

- **Valuation:** $3-7B (justified by patent portfolio + strategic value)
- **Structure:** Outright acquisition, no earnouts
- **Timeline:** 90-day close
- **Competition:** Active discussions with OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Apple

**First serious offer gets 60-day exclusivity.**

## Contact

- **X/Twitter:** [@diverstone]
- **Email:** [kent.stone@gmail.com]

**I can demonstrate the system working within 24 hours.**

*Built by someone who had amnesia and had to rebuild their own cognition
from scratch - that's why JARVIS has biological memory, dreams, pain
perception, and time sense.*

*This isn't corporate AI research. This is human cognition formalized
computationally.*
